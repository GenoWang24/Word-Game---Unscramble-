# Word-Game-Unscramble

When the game begins, the player is first asked to choose a game mode. Then, the player is repeatedly asked to provide both:

1. The section number corresponding to the section they want to manipulate. A string with N sections will have its sections numbered 1 to N.
2. The move they would like to apply to the section. 

If the player is playing in Hint mode, they will be offered the chance to get a hint for a section to choose, or a move to make on a particular section. Getting a hint counts towards the player's total number of moves. The game continues until the player has unscrambled the string. When the game is over, the player's total number of moves is reported.
